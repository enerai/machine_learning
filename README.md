# machine_learning
some machine learning projects.
* /regression/: use logistic regressoin (with/without regularizer) to predict the student's admission and check the validation of microchips
* /oneVsAll_classifier/: use multiple logistic regression to recognize hand-written letters. (5000 training samples)
* /neural_networks/: use neural networks to recognize hand-written letters. (25 hidden units)
* /svm_spam/: use SVM to divide linear/non-linear separable data points and then visualize the boundary; use SVM to filter spam (linear/guassian kernel)
* /k_mean/: use k-mean for image comperssion; k-mean process visualization
* /pca/: use PCA to reduce the dimension of face images and visualize the difference.
* /anomaly_detection/: use multivariable gaussian distribution to find out the anomaly (1000 training samples, 11 features)
* /movie_recommendation/: use collaborative filtering to update the feature vectors of users and movies together (1682 movies, 943 users)
