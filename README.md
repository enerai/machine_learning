# machine_learning
some machine learning projects.
* /regression/: use logistic regressoin (with/without regularizer) to predict the student's admission and check the validation of microchips
* /oneVsAll_classifier/: use multiple logistic regression to recognize hand-written letters. (5000 training samples)
* /neural_networks/: use neural networks to recognize hand-written letters. (25 hidden units)
* /svm_spam/: use SVM to divide linear/non-linear separable data points and then visualize the boundary; use SVM to filter spam
* /k_mean/: use k-mean for image comperssion; k-mean process visualization
